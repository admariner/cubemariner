<WarningBox heading={`🐣  Preview`}>

The Cube GraphQL API is currently in Preview, and there may be changes in a
future version.

</WarningBox>

The Cube GraphQL API allows querying Cube.

## Getting started

First, ensure you're running Cube v0.28.58 or later. Then start the project
locally in development mode, and navigate to
`http://localhost:4000/cubejs-api/graphql` in your browser.

- In development mode, GraphiQL is enabled.
- There is only one query; `load`

You should see the GraphiQL interface:

<div
  style="text-align: center"

  <img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/API-Reference/GraphQL-API-1.png"
  style="border: none"
  width="80%"
  />
</div>

If you click the 'Docs' button in the top-right, you can explore the
introspected schema:

<div
  style="text-align: center"

  <img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/API-Reference/GraphQL-API-2.png"
  style="border: none"
  width="80%"
  />
</div>

## load

Get the data for a query from Cube.

Let's use an `Orders` cube as an example:

```js
cube(`Orders`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.orders`,

  measures: {
    count: {
      type: `count`,
    },
  },

  dimensions: {
    status: {
      sql: `status`,
      type: `string`,
    },

    createdAt: {
      sql: `created_at`,
      type: `time`,
    },
  },
});
```

A GraphQL query to return the number of orders by status would look something
like this:

```graphql
{
  load {
    orders {
      count
      status
      createdAt {
        day
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The equivalent query to the REST API endpoint would look like this:

```json
{
  "measures": ["Orders.count"],
  "dimensions": ["Orders.status", "Orders.createdAt"],
  "timeDimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "Orders.createdAt",
      "granularity": "day"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Modifying time dimension granularity

The granularity for a time dimension can easily be changed by specifying it:

```graphql
{
  load {
    orders {
      createdAt {
        month
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Specifying filters and ranges

Filters can be set on the load query or on a specific cube. Specifying the
filter on the load query applies it to all cubes in the query. Filters can be
added to the query as follows:

```
query GetOrders {
  load {
    orders(granularity: {time: month}, orderBy: { time: asc, count: desc }, time: {inDateRange: ["2015-01-01", "2015-12-31"]}}) {
      count
      status @include(if: $byCategory)
      created
    }
  }
}
```

Some other differences between the JSON query filters and the GraphQL filters to
note:

- `number` values are used for number types instead of strings
- The `notSet` filter is replaced by `{ set: false }`
- New `in` and `notIn` filters to check for multiple values
- `AND` and `OR` fields for boolean operators

The GraphQL API supports `@skip` and `@include` directives too:

```
query  {
  load(limit: 100, offset: 50, timezone: "America/Los_Angeles") {
    orders(granularity: {time: month}, orderBy: { time: asc, count: desc }, where: {isDraft: {equals: "NO"}, time: {inDateRange: ["2015-01-01", "2015-12-31"]}}) {
      count
      status @include(if: $byCategory)
      created
    }
  }
}
```

### Querying multiple cubes

Using the same `Orders` cube as before, let's try and get the numbers of
products for each order status too. We can do this by adding the `Products` cube
to our query as follows:

```graphql
{
  load {
    orders {
      status
      count
      createdAt {
        month
      }
    }
    products {
      count
    }
  }
}
```

## Limitations

- Currently, the security context cannot be set in the GraphiQL interface.
